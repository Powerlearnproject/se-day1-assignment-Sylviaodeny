6.	Maintenance: The maintenance phase involves ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software to address issues, add new features, and ensure its continued functionality and relevance.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
1. Waterfall Methodology:
- Characteristics: The Waterfall methodology is where each phase must be completed before moving on to the next. It includes distinct phases like requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, and deployment.
- Appropriate Scenarios: Waterfall is suitable for projects with well-defined requirements and a clear understanding of the end product. It works well for projects where changes are expected to be minimal once the project starts. For example, building a simple website with fixed requirements and a clear scope could be a scenario where Waterfall is appropriate.

2. Agile Methodology:
- Characteristics: Agile is an iterative and flexible approach that focuses on delivering working software in short iterations called sprints. It emphasizes collaboration, adaptability to change, and continuous improvement. 
- Appropriate Scenarios: Agile is suitable for projects where requirements are likely to evolve, and there is a need for frequent feedback and adaptation. It works well for complex projects where the end goal may not be fully understood at the beginning. For example, developing a mobile app where user feedback is crucial for feature enhancements could be a scenario where Agile is appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1.	Software Developer:
- Role: Software Developers are responsible for writing code, designing software solutions, and implementing features based on project requirements.
- Responsibilities: They analyze user needs, collaborate with stakeholders, write and test code, debug programs, and ensure software meets quality standards. They work closely with other team members to deliver high-quality software solutions.
 
2.	Quality Assurance Engineer:
- Role: Quality Assurance Engineers, also known as QA Testers, focus on ensuring the quality and reliability of the software being developed.
-Responsibilities: They create test plans, execute test cases, report and track bugs, and work to identify and resolve issues in the software. QA Engineers also collaborate with developers to improve software quality and ensure it meets the specified requirements.

3.	Project Manager:
- Role: Project Managers oversee the planning, execution, and delivery of software development projects.
- Responsibilities: They define project scope, set timelines, allocate resources, manage risks, and communicate with stakeholders. Project Managers ensure that projects are completed on time, within budget, and meet the quality standards set for the software.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software. development process. Give examples of each.
1.	Integrated Development Environments (IDEs):
- Importance: IDEs provide a comprehensive environment for software development, combining tools like code editor, debugger, compiler, and build automation tools in one place. They enhance productivity by offering features like code completion, syntax highlighting, and project management.
- Example: An example of an IDE is Visual Studio, which supports various programming languages like Visual Basic, C#, and C++. Visual Studio offers a rich set of tools for coding, debugging, and testing software applications.

2.	Version Control Systems (VCS):
